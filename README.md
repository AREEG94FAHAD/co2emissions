# co2emissions
Linear regression machine learning system to predict the co2 emission

In this report, a machine learning regression system is designed and implemented to compute the CO2 emissions of vehicles.
The dataset that was used for this experiment can be downloaded from this site. [FuelConsumption](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkML0101ENSkillsNetwork20718538-2022-01-01)

#### The independent variables are
- MODELYEAR
- MAKE 
- MODEL
- VEHICLE CLASS
- ENGINE SIZE
- CYLINDERS
- TRANSMISSION
- FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km)
- FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km)
- FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km)
- CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km)

#### The dependent variable is 
- CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km)

#### Tools
To implement the proposed system, four main libraries need to be downloaded. These libraries are listed below.
